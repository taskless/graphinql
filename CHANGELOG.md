## [3.7.0]

### Changed

- Relocation of `@taskless/graphinql` - The graphinql project is being split out into its own project as a simple typesafe GraphQL client with no dependencies on `graphql` or `graphql-tag`. It is published under the same package, but will now be located at https://github.com/taskless/graphinql and its versioning will be independent of the Taskless client libraries going forward
- Removed `isomorphic-unfetch` dependency
